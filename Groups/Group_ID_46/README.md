### FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM IMAGE 
  1. PIXEL AVERAGE-MEDIAN-MODE
  2. EDGE FEATURES

The purpose of this study is to extract and analyse pixel and edge features of an image.

<b>Software and Libraries:</b>

- Python 2.7 or higher
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV2
- Pandas
- Scikit-image


<b>Project Structure</b>

This project has two major parts :

<b>pixel_features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting features related to pixel of an image like Mean, Median, Mode of different channels (R,G,B) and also for entire image.

<b>Edge_Features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting edge features of an image using Canny Edge Detection algorithm and Prewitt's horizontal and vertical edge detector.

- We showcase the usage of above mentioned classes with examples in different .ipynb files named as:
  - Example_pixel_mean.ipynb
  - Example_pixel_median.ipynb
  - Example_pixel_mode.ipynb
  - Example_Edge_Detection_Canny.ipynb
  - Example_Edge_Features_Prewitt.ipynb
