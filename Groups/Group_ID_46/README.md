### FEATURE EXTRACTION FROM IMAGE 
  1. PIXEL AVERAGE-MEDIAN-MODE
  2. EDGE FEATURES

The purpose of this study is to extract and analyse pixel and edge features of an image.

This project is collectively done by Kshitij Gour and Sanchit Bhat. Kindly consider for Average Marking.

<b>Libraries used:</b>

- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV2
- Pandas
- Scikit-image


<b>Project Structure</b>

This project has two major parts :

<b>pixel_features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting features related to pixel of an image like Mean, Median, Mode of different channels (R,G,B) and also for entire image.

<b>Edge_Features.py -</b> This code contains class for extracting edge features of an image using Canny Edge Detection algorithm and Prewitt's horizontal and vertical edge detector.

- We showcase the usage of above mentioned classes with examples in different .ipynb files named as:
  - Example_pixel_mean.ipynb
  - Example_pixel_median.ipynb
  - Example_pixel_mode.ipynb
  - Example_Edge_Detection_Canny.ipynb
  - Example_Edge_Features_Prewitt.ipynb

<b>Edge_Features_Documentation</b> This file documents the Edge Features section.
<b>Pixel_Features_Documentation</b> This file doocuments the Pixel Mean-Median-Mode section.
