Both parts of this project i.e. LBP and LDP have been together done by Antara Chansarkar (0801CS171013) and Jahanvi Sisodiya (0801CS171029).Kindly Consider average marking.
The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of LBP on an image in python.

Local binary pattern (LBP) is a nonparametric descriptor, which efficiently summarizes the local structures of images.
LDP encodes the higher-order derivative information which contains more detailed discriminative features that the first-order local pattern (LBP) can not obtain from an image.

The following Local Binary Pattern folder contains 4 files:

## Local_Binary_Pattern_Documentation.pdf:
This file contains the analysis and description of the core concepts of feature extraction from image using LBP.

## ds_lbpcode.py:
This file contains the implementation of LBP in python on any image.

## DS_LBP_example_code.ipynb:
Contains a sample code that returns an LBP of an image for texture classification.
