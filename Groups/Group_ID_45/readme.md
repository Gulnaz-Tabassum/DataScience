## 2D-LPCCA and 2D-SPCCA
This project focuses on implementing the two-dimensional locality preserving canonical correlation analysis (2D-LPCCA) and the two-dimensional sparsity preserving canonical correlation analysis (2D-SPCCA) based on the work presented in the research paper titled '2D-LPCCA and 2D-SPCCA: Two new canonical correlation methods for feature extraction, fusion and recognition' by et.al.Xizhan Gao.
