step1: Firstly User has to call mainfunction1().
step2 : user has to enter the value for X and Y matrices.
step3: After entering matrices user will get the output corresponding to the value like first he will get  covariance matrix of left and right transform w.r.t X and Y.
step4: user will get the matrices for right transform after calculating of cov(x,y) , cov(x,x), cov(y,y).
step5: user will get the matrices for left transform after calculating of cov(x,y) , cov(x,x), cov(y,y).\
step6: user will get the max correlation between projections  after calculating covariance of projections and variance of projections.
step7: user will get Eigen values and Eigen vector for calculating left transform of X and Y matrices 
step8: After calculating eigen values and eigen vector user will get the left transform of X and Y matrices . 
step9: user will get Eigen values and Eigen vector for calculating right transform of X and Y matrices 
step10: After calculating eigen values and eigen vector user will get the right transform of X and Y matrices.
