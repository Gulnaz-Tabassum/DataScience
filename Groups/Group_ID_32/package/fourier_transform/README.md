# Fourier Transform

The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of fourier transform in python.  
The fourier transform is an important image processing tool which is used to decompose an image into its sine and cosine components. The output of the transformation represents the image in the fourier or frequency domain, while the input image is the spatial domain equivalent. In the fourier domain image, each point represents a particular frequency contained in the spatial domain image.  
The following folder contains following files:
## Fourier_Transform_Report.pdf:
This file contains the analysis and description of the core concepts of feature extraction particularly fourier transform.
## fourier_transform.py:
This file contains the implementation of fourier transform on any English alphabet. 
## test.py:
This file contains the example to get the fourier transform of an alphabet.  
## Fourier_Transform_Code_Documentation.html:
This file contains the detail description and documentation of the code in html format.
