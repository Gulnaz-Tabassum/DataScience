# Zernike Moments 
The following folder contains a detailed description and implementation of Zernike Moments in python.
Zernike Moments have been adapted for image processing in shape recognition schemes. The orthogonal properties of ZM suits them better for such applications because unlike geometric moments their invariants can be calculated independently to arbitrary high orders without having to recalculate low order invariants.These orthogonal properties also allow one to evaluate up to what order to calculate these moments to get a good descriptor for a given database. 

The following folder contains 4 files:

This file contains the analysis and description of the core concepts of Zernike Moments
## zm.py
This file contains the implementation of zernike moments in python.
## example.py
This file contains an example to implement zernike moments on an oval shape for feature extraction.
