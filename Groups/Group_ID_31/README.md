Documentation.pdf : This file contains description of analysis and implementation of morphological feature extraction of image.

Morphology.py : This file contains source code of implemented algorithms. 

0801CS171035_PROJECT2.html : This file contains details of sample programs along with examples.

0801CS171035_PROJECT2.ipynb : This file contains the executed programs based on implementation of project.

## GrayScale Intensity
The GrayScaleIntensity folder contains 5 files:

GrayScaleIntensity_Report.pdf : This file contains the analysis and description of the feature extraction from grayscale image.

GrayScaleIntensity.py : This file contains the implementation of grayscale feature extraction in python.

GrayScaleIntensity.html : This file contains the explanation of how to use this package with example.

GrayScaleIntensity.ipynb : Contains a sample code on feature extraction by using a GrayScaleIntensity.py.
